# les_2
Write a code, which will:

1. create a list of random number of dicts (from 2 to 10)

dict's random numbers of keys should be letter,
dict's values should be a number (0-100),
example: [{'a': 5, 'b': 7, 'g': 11}, {'a': 3, 'c': 35, 'g': 42}]
2. get previously generated list of dicts and create one common dict:

if dicts have same key, we will take max value, and rename key with dict number with max value
if key is only in one dict - take it as is,
example: {'a_1': 5, 'b': 7, 'c': 35, 'g_2': 42}
Each line of code should be commented with description.

Commit script to git repository and provide link as home task result.
